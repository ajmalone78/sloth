```
* Prefix: The character that is required to use bot commands. eg. !googlesearch Sloths
* Slack Token: The Slack token is ideally your own token or a token for an account with Admin access. This is required for commands such as !kick and !invite. If you don't want that or can't. Just enter your bots token again
* Slack API Token: This is your bots own token that is generated by Slack when you add a new Bot Integration. This is required for the bot to join your channel and use the API.
* Google Token: This is required to use the Google API. You'll need to generate a Google API (Server) Key and enable the Youtube Data API and the Custom Search API. You can do this here; https://console.developers.google.com/
* CSE Token: This is the custom search engine token that is required in order to use the Google Image function. You can generate one here; https://cse.google.com/create/new . When creating put the Sites to search as `*:google.com/*` and once created in the options enable `Image Search`
* Steam API Token: You'll need a SteamAPI key to make use of most of the Steam functions, you can generate one here; https://steamcommunity.com/dev
* Github API Token: This isn't required but without a token you are limited to 60 requests an hour. You can generate one from your Github Settings Page. IMPORTANT: It must be entered exactly as shown otherwise github will return an error, you must enter your github username and the token seperated by a : exactly. so slothy:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
* Include Forks: A setting for the github commit plugin to also scrape users repos if they are a fork, disabled by default as it can add a lot more work and requests.
* Wolfram App Key: WolframAlpha API key to make use of their engine
* Trakt.tv API Key: API Key for using the movie/show details plugin. In order to get a key you need to create a new app here; https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications . Once you have made an app, the API key is the client_id for the app.
