* Bot Name: Name of the bot in Slack. Note that this does not change the display name of the bot, that must be done through slack, this is only for the code to know who your bot is
* Prefix: The character that is required to use bot commands. eg. !googlesearch Sloths
* Slack Token: The Slack token is ideally your own token or a token for an account with Admin access. This is required for commands such as !kick and !invite. If you don't want that or can't. Just enter your bots token again
* Slack API Token: This is your bots own token that is generated by Slack when you add a new Bot Integration. This is required for the bot to join your channel and use the API.
* Google Token: This is required to use the Youtube API. You'll need to generate a Google API (Server) Key and enable the Youtube Data API. You can do this here; https://console.developers.google.com/
* Steam API Token: You'll need a SteamAPI key to make use of most of the Steam functions, you can generate one here; https://steamcommunity.com/dev
